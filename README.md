# Smart Tip
Common Tip Calculation Web Application

## BETA
This project is currently in development. But I have released a beta version. 
Users can add employees and there work hours including the employee profit. and the app will calculate the total shift hours, perhour wage and other parameters.

## Inspirasion 
The project was inspired by  where there is a tip distribution for employees (usually restaurants and bars).
I built this app to make the calculation time faster, easier, and just smarter.
Instead of sitting in front of a notebook and calculating hours for each employee, calculate how many hours everyone worked, hourly tip profit, and more calculations.
Everything will be faster using Smart Tip
