Any change that made will cause the app instantly recalculate all shift parameters (hours, perhour, etc)

## Inspirasion 
The project was inspired by workplaces where there is a tip distribution for employees (usually restaurants and bars).
I built this app to make the calculation time faster, easier, and just smarter.
Instead of manually calculating each employee share based on many different parameters, i built this app to make the calculating process much easier and transparent to all parties involved. 
The process will be simpler, faster and much more efficient.
